## Installation

You can install the Python bindings for SMPL-RS using pip:

```bash
pip install smpl-rs
```
## Dependencies
SMPL-rs can be a standalone library, but we recommend using it with [gloss](https://github.com/Meshcapade/gloss) for rendering and additional functionality. You could use it with other tools for visualisation, but most of the examples in `examples` are for usage with gloss. 

```bash
pip install gloss-rs
```
